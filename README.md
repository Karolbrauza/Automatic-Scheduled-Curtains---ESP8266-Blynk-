# Automatic-Scheduled-Curtains---ESP8266-Blynk-

This is my first DIY iot project basis on idea that I found here:  https://www.instructables.com/Motorized-WiFi-IKEA-Roller-Blind/.
I've remixed 3D models of stepper motor to cover driver. 
Due to size I decided to use ESP8266 on Wemos D1 mini board and write my own code in Arduino IDE which use Blynk. That made this installation simpler and gives opportunity to connected with mobile app.
